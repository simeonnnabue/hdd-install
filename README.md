We have Windows 10 loaded on to a Thumbdrive, but before we insert that and install Windows, we are going to boot up the PC and go into BIOS to check the boot order, and see if the PC is recognizing the drives we installed. After that restart the computer, and proceed with Windows installation

Once the PC is all set up with windows, go ahead and log in. The customer wants us to move the Page File to the SSD to help with performance. first we will open up computer management, then click on disk management. we will need to check to see which disks pop up, in our case only the 2TB HDD, so we had to format the SSD and add it to the computer. We gave the disk drive the letter X. Now that we have both disks showing up, we can go into System Properties - Performance Settings - click Andvanced, then click Change on Virtual Memory

After that go ahead and restart your computer. Now you have a 2TB HDD, and your Windows Page File is running off your SSD, this will help optomize system performance.
